Multiple loosely coupled pipelines exist to get data from different sources. Different framework and languages used e.g. Spark, Sci-kit, TensorFlow built using Python, R, Java. Multiple instances: A/B test and ensemble model multiply the complexity. Culture: Data science (research and production ops) have different culture and expertise.Lesson Learned: operationalization and integration testing.
