A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This allows the model to learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases. This in turn allows it to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and write different questions in an informative way. LLMs are trained using a process called supervised learning. Inference is the process of using an LLM to generate output. Different architectures have differentstrengths and weaknesses. LLM steerability means controlling or changing LLM responses by giving it a persona or personality. A prompt is a short piece of text that is used to generate a specific output. This can involve using different types of prompts, such as open-ended prompts,c and adversarial prompts.
