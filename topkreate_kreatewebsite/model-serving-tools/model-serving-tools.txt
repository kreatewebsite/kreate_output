Tools for Model Serving
1.TensorFlow Serving: TensorFlow Serving is a flexible serving system specifically designed for
serving TensorFlow models in production. It provides a high-performance, scalable, and easy-touse interface for serving trained TensorFlow models over various protocols (e.g., gRPC, RESTful
API).
2.PyTorch Serving: PyTorch Serving (previously known as TorchServe) is a model serving library for
PyTorch models. It allows you to deploy and serve PyTorch models in a production environment
with features like model versioning, multi-model serving, and RESTful API support.
3.ONNX Runtime: ONNX Runtime is an open-source, high-performance inference engine that
supports the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. It provides optimized execution for
models trained with popular frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and others.
4.NVIDIA Triton Inference Server: Triton Inference Server is an open-source serving platform
developed by NVIDIA. It supports serving models trained with various frameworks, including
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX. Triton provides high-performance GPU inference, model
versioning, dynamic batching, and integration with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.

OpenVINO: OpenVINO (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) is a toolkit from Intel for
optimizing and deploying deep learning models across Intel hardware architectures. It provides optimized
inference for models trained with popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and it supports deployment
on CPUs, GPUs, and Intel's specialized accelerators.
TensorFlow Lite: TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework specifically designed for deploying models on
mobile and edge devices. It enables efficient inference on resource-constrained platforms and provides support
for on-device machine learning.
Core ML: Core ML is Apple's framework for deploying machine learning models on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and
tvOS devices. It allows you to convert trained models from popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and
ONNX into a format optimized for running on Apple devices.
