K-anonymity is a method of anonymizing data to protect the privacy of individuals. This means that it is not possible to identify an individual by looking at their data alone. L-diversity is a data anonymization technique that ensures that each group of records sharing a combination of quasi-identifiers contains at least l distinct values for each sensitive attribute. PyPI library PyAnonymize can be used to anonymize a variety of data types, including structured and unstructured data. For example, a generalization algorithm might replace the value"25" with the value "20-29" for a data set with a large number of records. For more information on PyPI, visit: www.pyPI.org.
