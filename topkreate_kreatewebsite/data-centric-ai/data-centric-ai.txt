Knobs - Data centric AI
Knobs are abstract levers

● Enable you to augment data in reliable manner
● Build gold data set that are compressed, well governed and good
quality.
● Enable you to handle PI, anonymize dataset
● Design abstractions that reduce the data and experience require
● Enable experimenting cheaper and faster.
● Reduce the data or experience require to make inference
