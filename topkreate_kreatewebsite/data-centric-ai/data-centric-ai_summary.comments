Data Centric AI focuses on the data used for AI. Focusing on high quality data that represent the world. Need less data and experience to learn optimal policy. Data Knobs are abstract levers that enable you to augment data in reliable manner. Build gold data set that are compressed, well governed and good quality. Data pipeline is the data that is used to build an AI system. Data-centric AI focus on building high quality datasets. It is the discipline of systematically engineering the data to build a system. It can be used to improve the quality of AI systems and reduce bias in models. It has the potential to reduce the cost of building AI systems. It could also be used as a training tool for computer scientists. It will help them learn how to use data to improve their own systems.
