Generative AI can be used to create synthetic data for training and testing AI models. This can help to improve the accuracy and performance of AI models for tasks such as malware detection and intrusion prevention. A cyber AI platform is embedded AI within a software that works around the clock to identify, isolate andaddress potential vulnerabilities. It should be able to detect rare and previously unseen threats and provide notification, visualization and analysis. Generative AI in Cyber security - Examples: IBM Security QRadar with Watson, Palo Alto Networks Cortext XDR, Cisco SecureX with Watson and Google Cloud's Chronicle uses generative AI to identify and respond to cyber threats.
