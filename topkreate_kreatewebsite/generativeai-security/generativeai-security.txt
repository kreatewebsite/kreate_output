Generative AI in Cyber security
1. Creating synthetic data for training and testing AI models. This can help to improve the
accuracy and performance of AI models for tasks such as malware detection and intrusion prevention.
2. Generating realistic phishing emails and other social engineering attacks. This can help
organizations to train their employees to identify and avoid these attacks.
3. Automating the analysis of security logs and other data. This can help to free up security
analysts to focus on more high-value tasks.
4. Discovering new security vulnerabilities. Generative AI can be used to analyze large amounts of
code and data to identify potential vulnerabilities that may not be apparent to human analysts.
5. Generating new security controls. Generative AI can be used to design new security controls that
are more effective at preventing and detecting attacks.

It should be able to detect rare and previously unseen. Provide notification, visualization.
It should learn from previous attacks and use GenAI to simulate new attacks/data. Using this it can detect
new threats.
Advance AI security system will also be able to respond to new

Generative AI in Data Protection - Examples
1. Data anonymization: Generative AI can be used to create synthetic data that is similar to real-world
data, but does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). This data can then be used for
training and testing AI models without the risk of exposing PII.
2. Data encryption: Generative AI can be used to create encryption keys that are more secure and
difficult to crack. This can help to protect data from unauthorized access.
3. Data obfuscation: Generative AI can be used to obfuscate data, making it more difficult to
understand or interpret. This can help to protect data from unauthorized access or use.
4. Data watermarking: Generative AI can be used to watermark data, embedding a unique identifier
into the data that can be used to track the data and identify its source. This can help to protect data
from unauthorized use or distribution.
5. Data privacy policies: Generative AI can be used to generate data privacy policies that are more
comprehensive and user-friendly. This can help organizations to better protect the privacy of their
users' data.

Bots - AI for Security
1. Incident response: Once incident occurs, notify stakeholders and answer
2. Education bot: Educate employees and stakeholders on security
3. Emerging threats: Read public sources and news about security. Answer and educate new threats,
evolving threats and answer mitigation question.
4. Threat intelligence: Read vulnerability reports,
5. Vulnerability scanning: Scan network, Scan system of vulnerabilities.
