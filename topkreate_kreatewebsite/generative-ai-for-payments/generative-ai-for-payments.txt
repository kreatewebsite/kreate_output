Fraud detection and prevention: Generative AI can be used to generate new fraudulent
transactions that can be used to train and improve fraud detection models. This can help to keep
fraudsters one step ahead and protect consumers from financial losses.
Personalization: Generative AI can be used to personalize payment experiences for each individual
customer. This could include things like suggesting relevant products or services, offering discounts or
promotions, or providing tailored customer support.
Credit scoring: Generative AI can be used to create new credit scoring models that are more accurate
and fair. This could help to make credit more accessible to people who have been traditionally
discriminated against.
Payment optimization: Generative AI can be used to optimize payment processes and reduce costs.
This could include things like automating payments, streamlining reconciliation processes, or
identifying and resolving payment errors.
Compliance: Generative AI can be used to help businesses comply with complex payment regulations.
This could include things like generating compliance reports, identifying potential compliance risks, or
providing guidance on how to comply with new regulations.
