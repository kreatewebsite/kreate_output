A framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs)
Allows you to chain together different components to create more complex and powerful
applications

● Key features

Composable: You can easily combine different LLMs, prompt templates, and agents to create
custom applications
Flexible: LangChain can be used for a variety of tasks, including chatbots, question answering,
summarization, and more
Extensible: LangChain is open source and extensible, so you can add your own custom
components

The core of LangChain is the concept of chains.
A chain is a sequence of calls to LLMs, prompt templates, and agents.
Chains can be simple or complex, depending on your needs.
For example, a simple chain might consist of a single LLM that is used to
generate text.
● A more complex chain might consist of multiple LLMs that are used to perform
different tasks, such as question answering and summarization.

Prompt templates:
● Prompt templates are used to specify the input and output of a chain.
● They can be used to control the behavior of the LLMs in a chain.
● For example, a prompt template might specify the type of text that the LLM
should generate, or the question that the LLM should answer.

Agents:
● Agents are used to make decisions about how to interact with the
environment.
● They can be used to control the flow of a chain, or to select the appropriate
LLM for a given task.
● For example, an agent might decide whether to ask a question to an LLM or to
search for the answer online.

Applications:
● LangChain can be used for a variety of applications, including:
