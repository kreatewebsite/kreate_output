LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs) Allows you to chain together different components to create more complex and powerful applications. You can easily combine different LLMs, prompt templates, and agents to create custom applications. LangChain is open source and extensible, so you can add your own custom components to it. It can be used for a variety of applications, including chatbots, question answering, data analysis, and more. The core of Lang chain is the concept of chains. A chain is a sequence of calls to LLMs and prompt templates. It is composable and flexible, making it a valuable tool fordevelopers and researchers.
