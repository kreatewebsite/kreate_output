●
●
●
●

Programming language it support
Visualization it support
Versioning
Sharing
Single node vs cluster
Does it provision new instance or attach to existing instance
Does output will be used for analysis or you want to include notebook in DAGs
in airflow etc
● Where it will be deployed

Google Colab
Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code. It has
a number of advantages over other Jupyter notebook hosting services, including:
●
●
●
●
●

Free GPU and TPU access: Google Colab offers free access to GPU and TPU hardware, which can significantly
speed up your code.
Collaboration: Google Colab notebooks can be easily shared and collaborated on, making them ideal for team
projects.
Version control: Google Colab notebooks are automatically saved to GitHub, so you can easily track changes and
revert to previous versions.
Easy setup: Google Colab requires no setup, so you can start coding right away.
Wide range of libraries: Google Colab supports a wide range of Python libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and
scikit-learn.

Azure Machine Learning notebooks are a specialized type of Jupyter notebook that is designed for machine
learning. They provide additional features, such as experiment tracking and model deployment, that make it easier
to build and deploy machine learning models.
Azure Databricks notebooks are a powerful tool for big data processing and analysis. They are based on the
Apache Spark platform and provide a wide range of features for data wrangling, machine learning, and visualization.

Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances are fully-managed Jupyter notebooks that can be used to run code in a
variety of languages, including Python, R, and Scala. SageMaker Notebook Instances are a good option for data
scientists and machine learning engineers who want to quickly and easily start working with data.
Amazon EMR Notebooks are a managed environment based on Jupyter and Jupyter-lab notebooks, which enables
users to interactively analyze and visualize data, collaborate with peers, and build applications using EMR clusters.
EMR Notebooks is designed for Apache Spark, and it supports Spark Magic kernels, which allows you to remotely
run queries and code on your EMR cluster using languages like PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark R, and Scala.
Amazon SageMaker Studio is a fully integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning that includes a
variety of notebook types, including Jupyter notebooks, RStudio notebooks, and SQL notebooks. SageMaker
Studio is a good option for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want a comprehensive environment
for developing, testing, and deploying machine learning models.

Disadvantages
Things are hidden behind Data Scientist Desk in notebook

It is important that work done in notebook or insight generated from Notebooks
are included in acknowledgement system.
