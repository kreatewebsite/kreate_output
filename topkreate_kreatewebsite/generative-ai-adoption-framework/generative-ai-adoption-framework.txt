Generative AI Adoption - Maturity Phases
Phase

Description

PoC

Team experiment, focus on learning

Tactical

Simple use cases for tactical need.
Minimal disruption and team get comfortable in rolling out generative ai to PROD. Focus is
on proving technology and less significance is on ROI

Well Governed

Test cases, governance policies are in place to deliver generative AI.
Org structure in place to review, approve generative AI use cases.
Enterprise gain expertise where to take caution related to risk, cost, copy-right issues and
areas where there are opportunities to generate value from geenrative ai.

Strategic

Deliver business value in multiple use cases.
Bring efficiency, cost saving

Transformational

New use cases, new data sets are built.
Give competitive advantage,

Generative AI - Challenges and Threats
AI has challenges - bias, interpretability, loss of control. Generative AI expand these threats

Areas to consider

Description

New threats

new trajectories, has more blind spots

Change to existing threats

People can be targeted, Effective in fake content,

Expansion to existing threats

The costs of attacks may be lowered by the
scalable use of generative AI systems to complete
tasks that would ordinarily require human labor,
intelligence and expertise.

Challenges
1. Ethical concerns (Fake content, malicious, copyright issue)
2. High compute costs
3. Data Quality
4. Data Availability
5. Mapping objective to feasibility
6. Algorithm hallucination (require guardrail)
7. Staleness and feedback loop
8. Interpretability
9. Token constraint
10. Ability to keep state (working memory)

Generative AI - Uncontrolled behavior
1. Generative AI model are un supervised/self supervised. There is no labeled
truth to evaluate even on training data.
a.

By design they produce different data even fiction. It is hard to quantify their accuracy.

2. Generative AI model produce output for variety of tasks e.g Q&A, writing
articles, summarizing.
a.

It is hard to provide accuracy/evaluate for variety of tasks

3. Generative AI models are complex deep learning models
a.

It is hard to explain or test for all conditions
