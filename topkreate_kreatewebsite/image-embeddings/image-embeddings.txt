Image classification: Image embeddings can be used to train machine learning models to classify images into
different categories. For example, an image embedding could be used to train a model to classify images of dogs,
cats, and cars.
Image retrieval: Image embeddings can be used to retrieve similar images from a database. For example, an
image embedding could be used to find all of the images of dogs in a database of millions of images.
Image similarity: Image embeddings can be used to measure the similarity between two images. For example, an
image embedding could be used to determine if two images are of the same object or not.
Image editing: Image embeddings can be used to edit images. For example, an image embedding could be used to
remove an object from an image or to change the color of an object in an image.
Image generation: Image embeddings can be used to generate new images. For example, an image embedding
could be used to generate a new image of a dog that is similar to a given image of a dog.
