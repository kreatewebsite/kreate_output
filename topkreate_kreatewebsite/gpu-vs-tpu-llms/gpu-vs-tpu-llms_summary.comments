GPUs and TPUs are specialized processors that can be used to accelerate machine learning workloads. They have different strengths and weaknesses, and are suited for different tasks. Larger models with more parameters will require more GPU memory and compute power for inference. For large models you'll generally want a high-memory (16GB+), modern, high-end GPU like an RTX 3090 or Quadro RTX. Using optimized frameworks like TensorRT or optimizations in PyTorch/TensorFlow canimprove throughput and reduce memory usage. Using multiple GPUs, batching, and framework optimizations can further improve performance. The optimalsetup depends on your specific model and use case. Start with benchmarks on available hardware and scale up accordingly. For example, Anthrop used A100 with 128 Nvidia GPUs (each with 32GB+ memory) to train LLMs.
