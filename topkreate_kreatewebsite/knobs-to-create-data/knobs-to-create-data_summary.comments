Knobs : Use knobs to define properties of data e.g. sparsity, density, distribution. Build datasets based on statistical properties using generative models. Build labels on existing datasets using weak supervision. Use dataset in one domain to convert in other domain. Generate effective data to learn optimal policy.Produce data that is similar to real world events. Use data to handle cold start problem.Generate data to deal with cold start problems. Use datasets to manage data privacy. Use them to create new datasets. Use these tools to help you build your own dataset. Use the following tools to create your own datasets: KREATE, DATAKNobs, and DATASET. Use this tool to build your dataset.
